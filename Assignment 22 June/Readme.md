# RESTful API using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express

This is a basic RESTful API built using Node.js, MongoDB and Express.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine.

2. Clone this repository.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:
   npm install

4. Configure the database connection:

- Open the `db.js` file located in the root directory.
- Replace `'your-database-name'` with the actual name of your MongoDB database.

5. Start the server by running the following command in the terminal:
node server.js


## API Endpoints

# GET /students
- Fetch all the students from the database.
- Returns a JSON response with an array of all the students.

# GET /students/:id
- Fetch a specific student by their ID from the database.
- Returns a JSON response with the student's details.

# POST /students
- Create a new student in the database.
- Accepts JSON data in the request body with the student's details.

# PUT /students/:id
- Update an existing student in the database.
- Accepts JSON data in the request body with the updated student's details.
- Finds the student by their ID and updates their information in the "students" collection.

# DELETE /students/:id
- Delete a specific student by their ID from the database.
- Removes the student from the "students" collection.

Challenges and Solutions:

During the development process, you may face challenges such as handling errors, validating data, or managing the database connection. Here are some common challenges and their solutions:
   - Challenge: Error handling - It's important to handle errors properly and provide    
               meaningful error messages to the API consumers.
    Solution: Use try-catch blocks to catch any errors that occur during the execution of 
              your code. 
   - Challenge: Data validation - Ensuring that the data sent to your API is valid and meets 
               the required criteria.
    Solution: Use conditional statements to check for missing or invalid fields in the 
              request body. If any required fields are missing or invalid, send an appropriate 
              error response.
   - Challenge: Proper Database Connection
    Solution: Create a separate module (db.js in this case) to handle the database      
              connection. Use Proper Message to see whether its connected or not.

Note:
This is a basic implementation of a RESTful API using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. You can enhance and customize it based on your specific requirements and learning objectives.
